 * It select a channel for the receiving radio of each node and switch the transmitter radio to send data to neighbors. hello messages are used to coordinate neighbors.
 *  For each node we do the following: 
 * 1- Add one  data queue for each channel 
 * 2- Add one hello-queue for each channel
 * Push every Hello to hello-queue of the channels we have neighbors on it
 * Push every received data to the data-queue of the corresponding channel
 * Each time we got a packet the module check the header and try to find the responsible neighbor for that, then it would check the channel of the neighbor and push the packet to the corresponding channel.
 * during the sending period the module check all channels and send packets corresponding to each channel.
